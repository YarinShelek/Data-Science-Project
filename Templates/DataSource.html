        <h2>In this project, we decided to crawl U.gg, which is a site that has many statistics about the game "League of Legends", and in particular, <br>
            it has data for each ranked player in the server (we chose euw as our data resource).<br>
            In order to get the data, we crawled their website, as they serve no API. <br>
            When we tried to use BeautifulSoup, we realized the site was not giving us the correct html, and we realized it was being generated by JS.<br>
            After a brief research online we learnt about selenium, and that it is the solution to our problem.<br>
            We learnt how to use selenium and went ahead and used it. <br>
            The site was pretty aggressive towards our crawling,<br>
            blocking us many times (when they did we just made our program refresh the page until it was ready) and we ended up multi-threading the crawl in order to increase our data accumulation rate.<br>
            In the end, this is the original data we have acquired:</h2><br>
